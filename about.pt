title: 'The 7 Hours of Creation'
description: 'Creating a Static Site Using GitHub and Hugo.'
summary: "First off creating this site did not actually take me 7 hours. In fact, it was relatively quick and minus a few hiccups here and there was a smooth process.I will be sure and include links/videos I used at the end of the article in case you all would like to reference them, but my hope is to do a well enough job here you wouldn't need to. With that being said letâ€™s dive in! ." # For the post in lists.
